        /// LGLCD_SYNC_COMPLETE_WITHIN_FRAME() is used, an error is returned to the calling 
        /// application when this condition arises.
        /// 
        /// The benefit of using the synchronous update is that your application will run “locked” with 
        /// the LCD updates. It will be suspended for the entire duration of writing to the screen, 
        /// and only get to run when the display is ready to accept a new screen. A “mini-game” on the
